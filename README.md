# Syriac

This repo is a research environment for the study of the (Old Testament)
[Peshitta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshitta).

The Peshitta is the ancient Syriac translation Old Testament.
Originating from the 2nd cent. AD, it is still the standard text of the Bible in many churches
that use the Syriac language in their liturgy.
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshitta).
  
You can run your own programs off-line, and publish your work in online notebooks.
To that end, the plain text of the Peshitta has brought into
[Text-Fabric](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/about/fileformats.html)
format, which is a good starting point for textual data processing.

For **authors**, **provenance** and **license**: see [About](docs/about.md).

# Software

The main processing tool is [Text-Fabric](docs/textfabric.md). It is instrumental to
turn the analysis of ancient data into computing narratives.

The ecosystem is Python and Jupyter notebooks.

# Getting started

Start with the
[tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/annotation/tutorials/blob/master/peshitta/start.ipynb).

# Status

*   2021-03-11 New release based on new and improved data
*   2018-10-16 Peshitta as a full-blown Text-Fabric [app](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/about/use.html).
