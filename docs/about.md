Peshitta
==============================

This repo is a research environment for the study of the (Old Testament)
[Peshitta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshitta).

You can run your own programs off-line, and publish your work in online notebooks.
To that end, the plain text of the Peshitta has brought into
[Text-Fabric](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/about/fileformats.html)
format, which is a good starting point for textual data processing.

*Researchers who want to do philological or text-historical study on the Peshitta OT
should consult the critical apparatus in the printed edition (not in this repository).
An electronic edition of the Peshitta including its full critical apparatus
has been prepared by the Eep Talstra for Bible and Computer
([ETCBC](http://www.etcbc.nl/)) and has been published in the
[Brill Peshitta Online](https://brill.com/view/db/peso).*

The general editors of the Peshitta Project are
[Bas ter Haar Romeny](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/rb-ter-haar-romeny)
and

Corpus
======

The [source](https://github.com/ETCBC/peshitta/tree/master/source)
directory in this repo contains transcription files in the ETCBC/WIT format.

These files have been converted into Text-Fabric format,
We have a [specification](transcription.md) of the transcription format and
how we model the text in Text-Fabric.
The conversion result is available
in the [tf](https://github.com/ETCBC/peshitta/tree/master/tf) directory.

It is possible that the conversion program and the sources
undergo modifications.
This will lead to never versions of the data in the *tf* 
directory.

Provenance
===========

The Electronic OT Peshitta Text provides an electronic version of the
[Vetus Testamentum Syriace (VTS)](https://brill.com/view/serial/PES),
prepared by the Peshitta Institute Amsterdam and published by Brill Publishers.
For those books that have already appeared in VTS,
the main text of the edition is given as the electronic text.
For the remaining books, the text of the
[Codex Ambrosianus](http://syri.ac/bibliography/1176620468)
is used.
This codex is the main source for the VTS edition
for this manuscript
(see also A.M. Cerianiâ€™s
[facsimile](https://archive.org/details/CerianiTranslatioSyraPescittoVeterisTestamentiExCodiceAmbrosiano/page/n0)
edition).

The printed edition contains a critical apparatus.
